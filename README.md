<!--- I am a CS Freshman at [The University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/). I love researching and working with Machine Learning, especially Computer Vision. Coming from the software and robotics background, I contribute extensively to/ maintain popular open-source projects like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/), [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) among others. I also love building open-source projects (usually related to Kubernetes and Machine Learning), some of which have been pretty popular -->
